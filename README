This is my repository for a genetic learning algorithm I developed in python, 
contact me at phillipsshawn53@gmail.com with any questions.

It starts by creating 1000 dots, each with 700 sets of instructions ranging from 0 to 5 pixels of movement to the right and -9 to 9 pixels up
that the dot will follow once per frame

It then takes two randomly chosen fit parents from the last generation,
it splits up their brains
and it shoves the brains up the ass of their children.

following this it will mutate those brains and send them on their way

It starts with about 20 percent of the dots making it to the goal,
in its current state it will have a total average of around 60 percent of 
the dots making it to the goal by generation 100 and by generation 1000 
around 70 percent of the dots will make it
